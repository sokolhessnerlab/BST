### Variables of Interest



**STRESS**
    - (1) "Acute stress was found to have no effect on risk attitudes, loss aversion, or choice consistency, though participants did become more loss averse and more consistent on the second day relative to the first. In the context of an inconsistent previous literature on risk and acute stress, our findings provide strong and specific evidence that acute stress does not affect risk attitudes, loss aversion, or consistency in risky monetary decision-making."

    - (2) "Acute stress significantly decreases men’s risk aversion (as measured by a lottery-choice risk-elicitation task)."

 **ATTITUDES**
    - (1) The extent to which an individual invests in and trusts others with different racial backgrounds is related to the magnitude of that individual's implicit race bias. The core dimension of social trust can be shaped, to some degree, by attitudes that reside outside conscious awareness and intention.

    - (2) We show that: (a) although political scientists use the BIAT and the AMP to measure the same thing, the relationship between them is substantively indistinguishable from zero; (b) both measures classify an unlikely proportion of whites as more favorable toward Black Americans than white Americans; and (c) substantial numbers of whites that either measure classifies as free of prejudice openly endorse anti-Black stereotypes.

**AMP Procedure Write-Up**

The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) is a psychological task for measuring implicit attitudes toward various stimuli (i.e., groups based on race or gender) by assessing a subject's response to a prime category (i.e., black or white faces) through evalutation of the subject’s response to a neutral stimuli (i.e., static and/or pattern) that follows. In the case of the AMP used in this study, subjects were briefly presented with a prime of black or white faces for a length of time to recognize the stimulus without evaluation (<100 ms).  Following the prime, participants were consecutively shown two neutral stimuli, an ink blot then static. Subjects were then asked to ignore the prime and the inkblot and make a judgment of “pleasant” or “unpleasant” about the static.
The main premise behind the “missatribution of affect” in the AMP is that though participants are told to ignore the prime and have two subsequent images to maintain in visual working memory, resulting in negligible maintenance of the initial primed stimuli (i.e., black versus white face), the emotional response to the prime remains.  Therefore, implicit attitudes of a subject are inferred from differences of their judgments of “static” before seeing the different categories of the prime.  The AMP allows an indirect view into biases a subject carries towards a category of which the subject may not be aware.
