## BST Data Processing & Key Findings ####

# Updated 8/29/2024

# This document is used to document note-worthy findings that arise during the process of wrangling and analyzing the BST data.  Key findings are then entered into summary_mainfindings.md found in the main Github/bst folder.

# Note: the data wrangling and data analyzing sections are separate here.  Those can be combined/reconciled once all data has been wrangled.

#### KEY FINDINGS ####


BST main premise: Does stress impact trust?  What role do attitudes play in outcomes?

STRESS only: 

Q: Did the acute stressor work? 

✅ Yes. Participants are more stressed after the CPT (stress condition).
(1) The cold pressor task rated much more uncomfortable vs. the lukewarm bath.
(2) Cortisol levels are higher after CPT.

✅ Day Effects:
    T-tests indicate the differences for the four cort samples across days are not significant (i.e., reading 1 on both days - not considering condition - are not sig different).
    Day Effects (Control): People enter Day 2 with greater cortisol than day 1, however differences for the CONTROL condition between four cort samples across days is not significant (for any of the 4 readings). There does not appear to be a difference of day on CONTROL cort sample reading across days.

Key take-away: Day does not seem to affect cortisol readings.

✅ Condition: 
  Are there differences between the control vs stress condition between four cort samples?  A: Stress vs. control cort reading 3 are significantly different and reading 4 is approaching significance.  Readings 1 and 2 are not sig different. 
  Are there differences in cort readings across days per condition? Both visual representations and t-tests reveal that there is a clear increase in reading 3 under the stress condition that is not present in the control condition.
  Are the differences in readings (3 & 1) significant across conditions? t-test reveal cort reading 1 to 3 differences for control and stress condition ARE significant. p = 0.0007266. Also, cort reading 1 to 4 differences between the control and stress condition are significantly different. p = 0.006921. 
  Readings 1 and 3 differences for the control condition alone are not significant. Visual distributions also show positive skew under stress vs. differences distributed near zero with control condition. Plotting reading 3 to reading 1 difference for stress condition show most reading 3 values are greater than reading 1 values in the stress condition.
  
Key take-away: The stress condition does seem to have a significant impact on cortisol levels at reading 3 with some continued impact until reading 4.

𝤿 Extra: If stressor was given on day 2 impact cort reading 1 on day 2?  Are there individual differences here?  Check for anticipatory effect.

Q: Are the subjects chronically stressed? 

✅ Participants report mainly low to moderate chronic stress in our sample.
(1) Only 1 PSS high chronic stress (categorical)
(2) Median split also shows low-to-moderate range
(3) Overall PSS mean shows low-to-moderate range
𝤿 Extra: Did day 2 PSS score differ when the stress condition was on day 2?

Q; Are there interactions between chronic stress and cortisol?
(1) PSS and cortisol mean
(2) PSS and cortisol reading 1 to 3 dynamics



TRUST only: 

Q: How trusting (behaviorally) are people in our sample? 

𝤿 Are participants generally trusting in the trust game?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 What are reaction times during trust interactions?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 Extra: …

Q: How trusting (perceptually) are people in our sample? 

𝤿 Are participants generally trusting in during trust perceptions?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 What are reaction times during trust perceptions?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) With same vs. other race?
𝤿 Extra: …


ATTITUDES Only: 

Q: What kind of attitudes do people in our sample have? 

Implicit:
𝤿 Are people in our study implicitly race biased?
(1) AMP?

𝤿 Extra: …

𝤿 Are there reaction time discrepencies?
(1) AMP
Between races?
(2) IAT?
Between races?
𝤿 Extra: …

Explicit:
𝤿 Are people in our study explicitly race biased?
(1) MRS?
(2) SRS?
𝤿 Extra: …

𝤿 Are people in our study more intrinsically or extrinsically motivated to be less race biased?
(1) IMS?
(2) EMS?
(3) IMS-EMS comparison?
𝤿 Extra: …

𝤿 Are people in our study explicitly race biased?
(1) MRS?
(2) SRS?
𝤿 Extra: …

Other:
𝤿 What kind of contact do subjects have with black vs. white race?
(1) …
𝤿 Extra: …


INTERACTIONS: 


Q: Did attitudes have an impact on trust?

𝤿 TO DO: With stress condition, was AMP affected? 
𝤿 TO DO: With stress condition, was IAT affected?
𝤿 Extra: Did explicit attitudes survey data differ when the stress condition was on day 2?


Q: Did stress have an impact on trust?

𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust perceptions (ratings)?
𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust behavior (sharing)?
𝤿 Extra: Are those who trust more less impacted by stress (acute/chronic)?


Q: Did stress and attitudes have any interaction effects on trust?

𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust perceptions (ratings)?
𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust behavior (sharing)?
