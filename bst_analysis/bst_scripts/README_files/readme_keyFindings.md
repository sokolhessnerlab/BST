## BST Data Processing & Key Findings ####

This file is used to document note-worthy findings (and issues) that arise during the process of wrangling and analyzing the BST data. The most pertinent key findings are then entered into summary_mainfindings.md (Github/bst/bst_analysis/summary_mainfindings.md).

Note: the data wrangling and data analyzing sections are separate here and can be combined/reconciled once all of the study's data has been wrangled.



#### Key Take-aways from Data Characterization ####

> STRESS: 

**Acute stress**

✅ CPT (stress condition) unpleasantness rating and cortisol readings

** Cortisol ** - Cortisol levels peak at reading 3, as expected. Reading 4 is higher than readings 1 and 2, indicating the stressor is still effective in latter parts of the experimental tasks.

** Unpleasantness Ratings ** - Participants rated the stressor (Cold bath water) as far more unpleasant than the control condition (Lukewarm bath water).

**Chronic stress**

✅ PSS (Perceived Stress Scale) - Participants in our study had low to moderate chronic stress levels.

Note: The first 3 participants did not complete a PSS.


> TRUST:

**Trust Behavior**


**Trust Ratings**


> ATTITUDES:

**Implicit attitudes**

 ** AMP **

Across subjects, mean AMP score was close to zero, indicating that our sample across subjects was not biased towards black or white AMP stimuli (M = -0.00846)

NOTE: Overall, AMP d-score was normally distributed, however one subject had a very strong negative black bias (AMP d-score = -4.45), which is 4 SD below the mean (-0.00846) group amp score



 ** IAT **

NOTE: Due to a programming error, the order of participants’ IAT congruent vs. incongruent blocks were not fully randomized.Participants completed an equal number of congruent and incongruent blocks, however the order was randomized for only 6 participants and not randomized for 33 participants.  

Subject 3 and subjects 12 and greater received incongruent-first on both days, while subject 6 had congruent-first on both days. Consequently, 32 participants had incongruent-first on both days while 1 participant had congruent-first on both days.

Since this programming error resulted in a greater number of incongruent-first blocks, the result in absolute levels of bias for participants will likely be less trustworthy with a lower IAT score overall compared to if randomization of congruent/incongruent blocks had occurred.  

In addition, the standard IAT is given multiple times with multiple flips between incongruent- and congruent-first blocks to lessen unsystematic variance  due to factors like practice and presentation order. The IAT modification used in this study was a simplified version geared to capture switching versus mapping, which likely results in an exacerbation of the underestimation of implicit bias.

#### KEY FINDINGS ####

BST main premise: Does stress impact trust?  What role do attitudes play in outcomes?

STRESS only: 

Q: Did the acute stressor work? 

✅ Yes. Participants are more stressed after the CPT (stress condition).
(1) The cold pressor task rated much more uncomfortable vs. the lukewarm bath.
(2) Cortisol levels are higher after CPT.

✅ Day Effects:
    T-tests indicate the differences for the four cort samples across days are not significant (i.e., reading 1 on both days - not considering condition - are not sig different).
    Day Effects (Control): People enter Day 2 with greater cortisol than day 1, however differences for the CONTROL condition between four cort samples across days is not significant (for any of the 4 readings). There does not appear to be a difference of day on CONTROL cort sample reading across days.

Key take-away: Day does not seem to affect cortisol readings.

✅ Condition: 
  Are there differences between the control vs stress condition between four cort samples?  A: Stress vs. control cort reading 3 are significantly different and reading 4 is approaching significance.  Readings 1 and 2 are not sig different. 
  Are there differences in cort readings across days per condition? Both visual representations and t-tests reveal that there is a clear increase in reading 3 under the stress condition that is not present in the control condition.
  Are the differences in readings (3 & 1) significant across conditions? t-test reveal cort reading 1 to 3 differences for control and stress condition ARE significant. p = 0.0007266. Also, cort reading 1 to 4 differences between the control and stress condition are significantly different. p = 0.006921. 
  Readings 1 and 3 differences for the control condition alone are not significant. Visual distributions also show positive skew under stress vs. differences distributed near zero with control condition. Plotting reading 3 to reading 1 difference for stress condition show most reading 3 values are greater than reading 1 values in the stress condition.
  
Key take-away: The stress condition does seem to have a significant impact on cortisol levels at reading 3 with some continued impact until reading 4.

𝤿 Extra: If stressor was given on day 2 impact cort reading 1 on day 2?  Are there individual differences here?  Check for anticipatory effect.

Q: Are the subjects chronically stressed? 

✅ Participants report mainly low to moderate chronic stress in our sample.
(1) Only 1 PSS high chronic stress (categorical)
(2) Median split also shows low-to-moderate range
(3) Overall PSS mean shows low-to-moderate range
𝤿 Extra: Did day 2 PSS score differ when the stress condition was on day 2?

Q; Are there interactions between chronic stress and cortisol?
(1) PSS and cortisol mean
(2) PSS and cortisol reading 1 to 3 dynamics
