#### KEY FINDINGS ####


BST main premise: Does stress impact trust?  What role do attitudes play in outcomes?


STRESS only: 

Q: Did the acute stressor work? 

✅ Yes. Participants are more stressed after the CPT (stress condition).
(1) The cold pressor task rated much more uncomfortable vs. the lukewarm bath.
(2) Cortisol levels are higher after CPT.
𝤿 Extra: If stressor was given on day 2 impact cort reading 1 on day 2?  Are there individual differences here?  Check for anticipatory effect.

Q: Are the subjects chronically stressed? 

✅ Participants report mainly low to moderate chronic stress in our sample.
(1) Only 1 PSS high chronic stress (categorical)
(2) Median split also shows low-to-moderate range
(3) Overall PSS mean shows low-to-moderate range
𝤿 Extra: Did day 2 PSS score differ when the stress condition was on day 2?



TRUST only: 

Q: How trusting (behaviorally) are people in our sample? 

𝤿 Are participants generally trusting in the trust game?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 What are reaction times during trust interactions?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 Extra: …

Q: How trusting (perceptually) are people in our sample? 

𝤿 Are participants generally trusting in during trust perceptions?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 What are reaction times during trust perceptions?
(1) Overall - across races?
(2) WIth same vs. other race?
𝤿 Extra: …


ATTITUDES Only: 

Q: What kind of attitudes do people in our sample have? 

Implicit:
𝤿 Are people in our study implicitly race biased?
(1) AMP?
(2) IAT?
𝤿 Extra: …

𝤿 Are there reaction time discrepencies?
(1) AMP
Between races?
(2) IAT?
Between races?
𝤿 Extra: …

Explicit:
𝤿 Are people in our study explicitly race biased?
(1) MRS?
(2) SRS?
𝤿 Extra: …

𝤿 Are people in our study more intrinsically or extrinsically motivated to be less race biased?
(1) IMS?
(2) EMS?
(3) IMS-EMS comparison?
𝤿 Extra: …

𝤿 Are people in our study explicitly race biased?
(1) MRS?
(2) SRS?
𝤿 Extra: …

Other:
𝤿 What kind of contact do subjects have with black vs. white race?
(1) …
𝤿 Extra: …


INTERACTIONS: 


Q: Did attitudes have an impact on trust?

𝤿 TO DO: With stress condition, was AMP affected? 
𝤿 TO DO: With stress condition, was IAT affected?
𝤿 Extra: Did explicit attitudes survey data differ when the stress condition was on day 2?


Q: Did stress have an impact on trust?

𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust perceptions (ratings)?
𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust behavior (sharing)?
𝤿 Extra: Are those who trust more less impacted by stress (acute/chronic)?


Q: Did stress and attitudes have any interaction effects on trust?

𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust perceptions (ratings)?
𝤿 TO DO: Did the stress condition impact trust behavior (sharing)?
