### Principal Variables of Interest

**STRESS**
    - (1) "Acute stress was found to have no effect on risk attitudes, loss aversion, or choice consistency, though participants did become more loss averse and more consistent on the second day relative to the first. In the context of an inconsistent previous literature on risk and acute stress, our findings provide strong and specific evidence that acute stress does not affect risk attitudes, loss aversion, or consistency in risky monetary decision-making."

    - (3) "Ventral tegmental area dopamine revisited: effects of acute and repeated stress."
       Stress can be defined as a threat to homeostasis caused by an aversive event (stressor) either physical or perceived.

    - (4) "Acute stress shifts the balance between controlled and automatic processes in prospective memory."
       Stress has been known to shift us towards simpler forms of learning, thinking, and planning.  Since stress can shift cognition, we wanted to see if stress may also have some impact on the way we trust.

    - (5) "Does stress make us more—or less—prosocial? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of acute stress on prosocial behaviours using economic games."
       According to a recent meta-analysis by Nitschke, acute stress has been shown to have inconsistent effects on prosocial behavior.  In fact, acute stress was found to not have significant effects on decision-making fundamentals like risk attitudes either.

     - (8) Acute stress may lead to more prosocial behaviors in sharing, cooperation, altruism, trust (Multiple References)

     - (9) In contrast to acute stress, chronic stress has been shown to cause neural circuitry imbalances that reduce cognition and decision making abilities (Multiple References)
     Stress can cause an imbalance of neural circuitry reducing cognition and decision making abilities. Stress can lead to utilization of more exploitative ways of exploring alternatives.

 **ATTITUDES**
    - (1) The extent to which an individual invests in and trusts others with different racial backgrounds is related to the magnitude of that individual's implicit race bias. The core dimension of social trust can be shaped, to some degree, by attitudes that reside outside conscious awareness and intention.
    Implicit attitudes of group membership can support or impede social trust and decisions. Previous work examining trust under implicit attitudes has demonstrated that group membership can impact social trust and decisions, namely that in-/out-group implicit biases can impact trust behaviors.

    - (2) We show that: (a) although political scientists use the BIAT and the AMP to measure the same thing, the relationship between them is substantively indistinguishable from zero; (b) both measures classify an unlikely proportion of whites as more favorable toward Black Americans than white Americans; and (c) substantial numbers of whites that either measure classifies as free of prejudice openly endorse anti-Black stereotypes.

    - (3) Explicit attitudes are beliefs and associations we can directly access and directly measure, while implicit attitudes we have little awareness of and thus measure by indirect means.  Explicit and implicit attitudes work on parallel systems and can be contrary to one another within same individual.  Implicit attitudes in particular have been shown to be a better predictor of behavior than explicit beliefs

    Stress can affect the potency of implicit attitudes we hold towards others. ER study demonstrated that cognitive stressors (overcrowding and patient load) were associated with increased implicit bias.

  **AMP Procedure**
  -The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) is a psychological task for measuring implicit attitudes toward various stimuli (i.e., groups based on race or gender) by assessing a subject's response to a prime category (i.e., black or white faces) through evaluation of the subject’s response to a neutral stimuli (i.e., static and/or pattern) that follows. In the case of the AMP used in this study, subjects were briefly presented with a prime of black or white faces for a length of time to recognize the stimulus without evaluation (<100 ms).  Following the prime, participants were consecutively shown two neutral stimuli, an ink blot then static. Subjects were then asked to ignore the prime and the inkblot and make a judgment of “pleasant” or “unpleasant” about the static.
  -The main premise behind the “misattribution of affect” in the AMP is that though participants are told to ignore the prime and have two subsequent images to maintain in visual working memory, resulting in negligible maintenance of the initial primed stimuli (i.e., black versus white face), the emotional response to the prime remains.  Therefore, implicit attitudes of a subject are inferred from differences of their judgments of “static” before seeing the different categories of the prime.  The AMP allows an indirect view into biases a subject carries towards a category of which the subject may not be aware.


 
- **TRUST**

- (1) The extent to which an individual invests in and trusts others with different racial backgrounds is related to the magnitude of that individual's implicit race bias. The core dimension of social trust can be shaped, to some degree, by attitudes that reside outside conscious awareness and intention.
