The primary function of this ReadMe file is to document important references for the main variables of interest: stress, attitudes, trust.

### Variables of Interest


**STRESS**
    - (1) "Acute stress was found to have no effect on risk attitudes, loss aversion, or choice consistency, though participants did become more loss averse and more consistent on the second day relative to the first. In the context of an inconsistent previous literature on risk and acute stress, our findings provide strong and specific evidence that acute stress does not affect risk attitudes, loss aversion, or consistency in risky monetary decision-making."

    - (2) "Acute stress significantly decreases men’s risk aversion (as measured by a lottery-choice risk-elicitation task)."

       - (3) "Ventral tegmental area dopamine revisited: effects of acute and repeated stress."
       Stress can be defined as a threat to homeostasis caused by an aversive event (stressor) either physical or perceived.
      Reference: Holly, E. N., & Miczek, K. A. (2016). Ventral tegmental area dopamine revisited: effects of acute and repeated stress. Psychopharmacology, 233(2), 163–186. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-015-4151-3
      
      - (4) "Acute stress shifts the balance between controlled and automatic processes in prospective memory."
       Stress has been known to shift us towards simpler forms of learning, thinking, and planning.  Since stress can shift cognition, we wanted to see if stress may also have some impact on the way we trust.
      Reference: Möschl, Walser, Plessow, Goschke, & Fischer (2017)

    - (5) "Does stress make us more—or less—prosocial? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of acute stress on prosocial behaviours using economic games."
       According to a recent meta-analysis by Nitschke, acute stress has been shown to have inconsistent effects on prosocial behavior.  In fact, acute stress was found to not have significant effects on decision-making fundamentals like risk attitudes either. 
      Reference: Nitschke, Forbes, & Lamm, (2022)

     - (7) "Acute stress does not affect risky monetary decision-making."
     Acute stress may have no effect on risk attitudes.

     - (8) Acute stress may lead to more prosocial behaviors in sharing, cooperation, altruism, trust (Multiple References)

     - (9) In contrast to acute stress, chronic stress has been shown to cause neural circuitry imbalances that reduce cognition and decision making abilities (Multiple References)
     Stress can cause an imbalance of neural circuitry reducing cognition and decision making abilities. Stress can lead to utilization of more exploitative ways of exploring alternatives.

 **ATTITUDES**
    - (1) The extent to which an individual invests in and trusts others with different racial backgrounds is related to the magnitude of that individual's implicit race bias. The core dimension of social trust can be shaped, to some degree, by attitudes that reside outside conscious awareness and intention.

    - (2) We show that: (a) although political scientists use the BIAT and the AMP to measure the same thing, the relationship between them is substantively indistinguishable from zero; (b) both measures classify an unlikely proportion of whites as more favorable toward Black Americans than white Americans; and (c) substantial numbers of whites that either measure classifies as free of prejudice openly endorse anti-Black stereotypes.
