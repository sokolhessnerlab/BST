Data Frame and Variable Descriptions

#Note: that because there were 3 participants who didn't take the PSS (and thus don't have scores), any data frame with _pss will have 36 participants, while those without _pss will have 39 (so if you don't need the PSS for an analysis, don't use the DF with _pss). That is there will several double DF's, one merged with the PSS scores with _pss, and one not merged without the _pss, they are identical except that that the _pss will have the PSS scores but 3 fewer participants

#Note: I describe here the "essential" DF's, as there are a few intermediary, "simple" DF's that are redundant with the "essential" ones. Feel free to use those ones, as they are just going to be simplified versions of the merged versions with all the possible columns

#Note: When data frames were merged for analysis, columns are carried over. I only describe each column for its "original" DF, but a given DF might have columns that originated in others. For a description of that column go to the "original" DF

>bst_bath
  -this contains the combined bath pleasantness rating data, as well as the bath order data for each individual participant
    $(control/stress)PleasantnessRating: the rating on a 1-7 scale of how pleasant to unpleasant the bath was
    $bathRecievedDay(1/2): what bath type a participant recieved on a given day (word format)
    $Run.: incomplete data on whether a participant was run? *Don't Use*
    $bdiffPleasantnessRating: the pleasantness rating after the cold bath minus the pleasantess rating after the lukewarm bath
    $day2StressedBool: whether a participant was given the cold bath or the lukewarm bath on day 2 (1=true, they were stressed, ie they had the cold bath on day 2)

>bst_pss
  -this contains each participant's PSS data (who had it)
    $unexpectedUpset/unableControl/nervous/$personalProblemConfidence/goingYourWay/couldNotCope/irritationControl/onTopOfThings/outsideOfControl/diffPilingUp: each of these is associated with a specific question in the PSS
    $(*)Recode: any of the aforementioned questions with a Recode on the end is simply a reverse scored version of the question, used in calculating the PSS score
    $pssSum: PSS score (0-40)
    $pssSumCategorical: using the "low" "moderate" "high" scoreing, a 3 way categorical version of the pssSum
    $pssMedianSplit: a binary split on whether a participant's pssSum was above (1) or below (-1) the median across the dataset

>bst_tg
  -this contains the Trust Game data
    $taskOrder: whether the trust game was first (ahead of the trust rating task) or second (behind the trust rating task) on a given day
    $blockNum: what block number a given trial was in
    $trialNum: what trial number a trial was (in a given block)
    $cumTrialNum: what trial number a trial was (overall)
    $stimulus: what picture a person was shown as their partner
    $shared: how much money in dollars a person shared with their partner
    $partnerChoice: whether a partner shared money back (1 = true) or not (0 = false), NaN if there was no choice to make
    $partnerRace: the stimulus picture (participant's partner) race, 0=white, 1=black, 2=other
    $recieved: how much money in dollars a person recieved on a given trial
    $responseTime: response time after seeing the stimulus
    $startTime: computer registered start time (should probably only be used in a relativistic fashion)
    $bonusTrial: which trial was randomly selected as the bonus for particpant
    $bonus: what the actual bonus was based on that randomly selected trial
    $stressedBool: whether a person had recieved the cold bath on the day this trust game was administered
    $prevTrialShared: whether a person shared anything on the previous trial (-1=they didn't, 0=no previous trial, 1=they did)
    $prevTrialSharedAmt: how much a person shared on the previous trial, 0 also including if there was no previous trial
    $prevTrialFeedback: whether a person saw their trust reciprocated on the previous trial (-1=they didn't, 0=no previous trial/they didn't share anything in the first place, 1=they did)
    $sharedBool: whether a person actually shared money or not on a given trial

>bst_tr
  -this contains the Trust Rating data
    $taskOrder/day/blockNum/trialNum/cumtrialNum/stimuls/partnerRace/responseTime/startTime/stressedBool: all the same as previously described, only for the trust rating instead
    $rating: what the trust rating was by a participant for a given trial was from untrustworthy (1) to trustworthy (9)
    $prevTrialRating: a lagged variable representing in boolean format whether a participant gave an untrustworthy (ie a rating from 1-4) (-1), trustworthy (ie a rating from 5-9) (1) rating for the previous trial, or whether there was no previous trial (0)
    $prevTrialRatingAmt: the rating given to a person by the participant on a previous trial (1-9), 0 being if there was not previous trial

>bst_t_compiled_part_avg
  -this contains the average data for each participant for each trust task (Game and Rating)
    $sharedAvg: the average amount shared by a given participant in the trust game
    $shareSD: a participants standard deviation in the shared amount in the trust game
    $sharedSE: a standard error for a participant in the shared amount in the trust game
    $shared(High/Low)SE: the average shared amount (+/-) the standard error for a given participant
    $ratingAvg: the average rating (ie trust rating) by a given participant
    $ratingSD: a participant's standard deviation in the rating in the trust rating task
    $ratingSE: a standard error for a participant in the rating in the trust rating task
    $rating(High/Low)SE: the average ratin (+/-) the standard error for a given participant

>bst_t_compiled_part_avg_stress
  -this DF is exactly the same as bst_t_compiled_part_avg except when everything was agreggated, it was also split out by whether a partcipant was stressed or not. That is, there are now 2 rows for every participant, 1 for their responses on the control day, and 1 for their responses on the stress day
