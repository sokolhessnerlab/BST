In this task, you will be presented with a set of words or images to classify into groups.
This task requires that you classify items as quickly as you can while making as few 
mistakes as possible. Going too slow or making too many mistakes will result in an 
uninterpretable score. The following is a list of category labels and the items that belong
to each of those categories.

Category Items

Pleasant words:       Great, Terrific, Wonderful, Fabulous, Superb, Nice, Fantastic, Lovely.
Unpleasant words:     Awful, Terrible, Horrible, Disgusting, Horrid, Foul, Revolting, Nasty.
Flowers:              Pictures of Flowers
Insects:              Pictures of Insects

The two labels at the top will tell you which words or images go with each key.  Every so 
often the labels at the top will change, switching which words or images go with each key.
At these times there will be a short break and you will be told to look at the categories.

Keep in mind

    * Keep your index fingers on the 'e' and 'i' keys to enable rapid response.
    * Each word or image has a correct classification. Most of these are easy.
    * The test gives no results if you go slow -- Please try to go as fast as possible.
    * Expect to make a few mistakes because of going fast. That's OK.
    * If you make a mistake, a red X will appear. You should then correct your response as
      quickly as possible.
