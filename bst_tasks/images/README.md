### Folder Contents

This folder contains all of the subfolders for the stimuli used in the BST task. Below is a description of the contents within each folder.


### Image Folder Guide 
Stimuli are split by computer task

-**AMP** : Visual stimuli used for AMP (both sessions 1 and 2 on each day).
    - **faces**: Collection of images, labeled by race, of faces used in the AMP task. They appear after the inkblot but before the image of static. There are more images in this folder than are used in one session, so not every participant will receive the same images. I'm not sure where these images came from.
    - **inks**: Collection of inkblots which are randomly sampled from during the task. There are more inkblots than there are trials per session, so not everyone will observe the same inkblots. They appear before the face image in each trial. Also not sure where they came from.
    - **masks**: Images of static. They appear after the face image, and are the image that participants observe while they make their response for each trial. While the face and inkblot images appear very briefly, the images of static remain on screen until the trial is completed. I'm also not sure where these came from.
    -**IAT**: Face images used for IAT. I don't know where these images came from since the IAT task was reformatted from someone else's code and files.
        - **blackFaces**: Images of Black faces used in the IAT task. 
        - **whiteFaces**: Images of white faces used in the IAT task.
    -**TRTG**:  These are the face stimuli used in the Trust Game and the Trust Rating tasks. Each of these tasks use separate image sets.
        - **rutgers**: This stimuli set contains images of men of various races and accompanying information about how they would respond to various amounts shared during an economic trust game (from 1-5 dollars). These are each person's real responses, based on a study that was conducted at Rutgers University that collected this dataset. Each person was explained the task (partners have the option to share between $0-5, that amount gets quadrupled, they can then decide whether to share half back or keep it all) and then asked whether they would share or keep if their partner shared $1, $2, etc. 
        Their answers are listed in the image name after "sk," with 0 meaning "keep" and 1 meaning "share". For example, an image that says "sk00000" means that they would not share the money back no matter how much was given. "sk11000" means that this person would share if they were given $1 or $2, but would keep if given $3-5. **This is the image set used for TG. All images are used, so participants will view the same faces in a randomized order each time they complete this task.**
        - **TGame**: These images were previously made and considered for use in the Trust Game, but have not ever actually been used in the task. I have no idea where they came from.
        - **TR**: A collection of faces, labeled by race, used in the Trust Rating task. There are more images than there are trials in one task, so not all participants will be see the same set of images. I also don't know where these images come from.
